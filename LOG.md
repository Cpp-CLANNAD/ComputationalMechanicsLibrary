# v0.1.5.20170120_Alpha
demo, just can use.
need packing those set up operations.
just like preprocessing

## Matrix
done
## FiniteElementMethod
### Core
doing
delete the dynamic's interface with normal element and solver
need rebuild
### PlaneRigidFrame
done
### SpatialBeam
doing
element is redundant
solver is sure


# v0.1.4.20170119_Alpha
do some special changes

## Matrix
done
## FiniteElementMethod
### Core
doing
change the interface module
### PlaneRigidFrame
done
### SpatialBeam
doing
element is redundant
solver Newmark, NodeIteration are sure

# v0.1.3.20170117_Alpha
do some special changes

## Matrix
done
## FiniteElementMethod
### Core
doing
change the interface module
### PlaneRigidFrame
element done
solver done
now method to solver be a lambda function
### SpatialBeam
doing
element not sure
solver will improve?

# v0.1.2.20170113_Alpha
PlaneRigidFrame is sure

## Matrix
done
## FiniteElementMethod
### Core
doing
global framework is sure
some change
### PlaneRigidFrame
element done
solver done
### SpatialBeam
have a Plan

# v0.1.1.20170112_Alpha
come from A old c# project
first push

## Matrix
done
## FiniteElementMethod
### Core
doing
global framework is sure
### PlaneRigidFrame
element done
